/**
 * @brief Manages the WiFi access point, captive portal, and user setup form.
 *
 * The access point is used to provide the user with a way to configure and set
 * up their device. After the user connects to the network using the fixed SSID
 * and passkey, they will be redirected to a setup form via a captive portal.
 * The form collects the user's WiFi credentials and any other needed
 * information (e.g. email address for first-time setup), then allows the
 * firmware to store the submitted response and connect to the internet.
 *
 * At the moment, once the access point is started it cannot be exited. The
 * firmware needs to do a software reset after handling a form submission to
 * begin normal operation.
